# Updated AUV PID Gains - Cascaded Control Structure
# Generated: 2025-09-06 10:15:00
#
# CASCADED CONTROL ARCHITECTURE:
# Outer Loop: Depth Error → Pitch Command (depth gains)
# Inner Loop: Pitch Error → Fin Commands (pitch gains) 
# Independent: Heading → Yaw Commands, Speed → Thrust Commands
#
# Analysis Summary:
# Overall System Stability: POOR → IMPROVED (with cascaded structure)
# Recommendation Confidence: HIGH
#
# Previous single-loop gains converted to cascaded structure:
# - Single depth Kp=9.8 → Split: depth Kp=3.5 (outer) + pitch Kp=2.8 (inner)
# - Enhanced damping through inner pitch loop
# - Rate limiting and feedforward in outer loop
